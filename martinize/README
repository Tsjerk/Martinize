Martinize.py is a python script to convert (atomistic) protein structures to 
Martini coarse grain (CG) structures and topologies. 

It has been originally been written by Djurre H. de Jong and Tsjerk A. Wassenaar 
and is currently maintained Djurre H. de Jong and Jaakko. J. Uusitalo. The 
script is written to be a useful tool, but comes with no warranty. If you use 
the script for any of your publications, please cite:

  INSTALATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
martinize.py is provided as a single-file script and no installation is needed
other than downloading the script. The newest, tested version of the script can 
always be downloaded from:

http://www.cgmartini.nl

Possible input arguments can be learned by typing "martinize.py -h" on the 
commmand-line. Notice that the script needs a working version of python 2. A 
python 3 version is available upon request.

  STRUCTURE & DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the final script comes as a single file, internally it consists of 
several "Modules". In the development version the modules all come in seperate
files. The one-file-script can be created by running "catenate.py".

Organization of the different modules:

1. Options and documentation                             @DOC.py
2. Description, options and command line parsing         @CMD.py
3. Helper functions and macros                           @FUNC.py
4. Finegrained to coarsegrained mapping                  @MAP.py
5. Secondary structure determination and interpretation  @SS.py
6. Elastic network                                       @ELN.py
7. Structure I/O                                         @IO.py
8. Topology generation                                   @TOP.py
9. Main                                                  @MAIN.py

Force field parameters are specified in the differentt forcefield modules,
e.g.: martini22_ff.py. In the development version all forcefields are
placed in the "ForceFields/" subdirectory.

When catenating the modules to the final script, one gets to choose which
forcefields to include. When later running the script one can use these
selected forcefields AND additional forcefields present in the working
directory. The latter allows for flexible implementation of own forcefields.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TESTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each version of martinize.py is tested for a number of protein structures, 
trying to cover as many aspect of its function as possible. The testset is
compiled in single script in the "tests/" subdirectory. It should be checked
that all stuctures run without error and the obtained structure and topology
files do not differ from previous versions.

It is impossible to test every possible usage scenario, and currently 
especially the multiscale functionalities are lacking.
