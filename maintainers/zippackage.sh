# Build a zip package of martinize
#
# In order to be easily used from the command line without installation, while
# being modular for developers and library users, we distribute martinize an
# executable zip. That zip can be called directly from the command line (e.g.
# `./martinize -h`) or through python (e.g. `python martinize -h`).
#
# The distributed zip is a zipped version of the repository prepended with a
# shebang.

# Path from which to download simopt
SIMOPT_URL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tsjerk/simopt/master/simopt.py'

# Zip is annoying when it comes to path inside the archive.
# We make a copy of the repository that we can modify without worrying to much.
